# callattendant
Link to Callattendant Docker Template and actual program
Im new to making a repository and helping the Unraid Community
this is a template for the program Callattendant for blocking phone calls viewing them
on Landline.. you can make it work in Home assistant so it speaks the numbers calling or name
i use this for my mother to be able to hear and read the call coming in..

the template is for callattendant-docker and that links to the callattendant program

since the writter for the callattendant-docker doesnt have Unraid.. i took it upon myself to 
make this so others can use this program if they like

when you do install it..
use a modem  if you dont it will either orphan or fail to install  so you need a usb modem or a pci modem
or delete the Variable Modem
